# Docker Speedtest Analyser

Automated docker speedtest analyser tool with included web interface to monitor your internet speed connection over time. Setup at home on your NAS (Synology, QNAP tested) and the container runs hourly speedtests. The speedtest results are displayed in an web interface as line graph(s) over the day.

This tool was created in reference to [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/43fi39/i_set_up_my_raspberry_pi_to_automatically_tweet/).
It used [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) to make speedtests and log them into a CSV file.
After that you can visit the web interface to view a hourly - time filterable reports about your internet connectivity speed.

You can get the publicly available docker image at the following location: [joelvaneenwyk/docker-speedtest-analyser](https://hub.docker.com/r/joelvaneenwyk/docker-speedtest-analyser/).

## Facts

4. First speedtest will be executed in container build

## Installation

The SpeedTest analyser should to run out of the box with docker.

**Important:** To keep the history of speedtest within a rebuild of
the container please mount a volume in ``/var/www/html/data/``

### Setup

2. Map preferred host port on port _80_
3. Build container from image
4. Enjoy continuous speed statistics after a while

## Environment Variables

| Variable  | Type | Usage |  Example Value | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| CRONJOB_ITERATION  | INT  | Time between speedtests in minutes. Value 15 means the cronjob runs every 15 minutes. Keep undefined to run hourly. | 15 | 60 |
